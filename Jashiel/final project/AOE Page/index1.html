      <p class="times">
       Welcome to AoE High School, where academic excellence is rooted in faith, purpose, and community.
        As a Christ-centered school, we are committed to nurturing the minds and hearts of our students, preparing them to thrive in all areas of life â€” intellectually, spiritually, and emotionally.
        In our in-person environment, students are challenged to grow not only in knowledge, but also in character, service, and leadership. At AoE, we believe education is a calling, and each student is uniquely gifted by God with a purpose to fulfill.
