        <p>Hi! My name is Joel, and I am a high school student passionate about learning, exploring new ideas, and preparing for my future. Whether it's diving into subjects like science, math, or literature, I enjoy gaining knowledge and challenging myself every day. My web page I made for this class is called Animal world and I hope you enjoy reading about it.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I love talking with friends, playing games, spending time with family, and of course animals. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow and improve while having fun!</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by and learning a bit more about me!</p>
