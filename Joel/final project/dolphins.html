        <h3 class="tiger-styles">Interesting Facts About Dolphins</h3>
        <p class="tiger-styles">Dolphins are highly intelligent creatures and can communicate using sounds, body language, and even signals. They are known for their playful nature, often seen leaping out of the water or riding waves near boats.</p>

        <h3 class="tiger-styles">Social Structure</h3>
        <p class="tiger-styles">Dolphins live in groups called pods, which can range from just a few individuals to over a hundred. These pods work together to hunt and protect each other from predators.</p>

        <h3 class="tiger-styles">Communication</h3>
        <p class="tiger-styles">Dolphins use a variety of sounds to communicate, including clicks, whistles, and echolocation. They have signature whistles that help identify individual dolphins within a pod.</p>

        <h3 class="tiger-styles">Problem-Solving</h3>
        <p class="tiger-styles">Dolphins are known for their problem-solving abilities. They can work together in creative ways to solve complex tasks, such as hunting in groups or using tools to help them obtain food.</p>

        <h3 class="tiger-styles">Threats and Conservation</h3>
        <p class="tiger-styles">Despite being considered "Least Concern" for most species, dolphins still face threats from habitat destruction, pollution, and accidental capture in fishing nets. Efforts to conserve their populations are ongoing, with several species classified as endangered.</p>
