      <h2>About Our School</h2>
      <p>
      Welcome to AoE High School—where faith drives purpose and learning has no limits. We challenge minds, shape character, and build leaders who stand strong in intellect, conviction, and heart. As a Christ-centered school, we believe education is more than knowledge—it's about impact. Here, students grow in wisdom, service, and leadership in a dynamic, in-person environment. Every student is uniquely gifted by God, and we’re here to help them step into their calling with confidence.
